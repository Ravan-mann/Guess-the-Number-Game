## 🧠 How It Works

1. A random number between 1 and 100 is generated when the page loads.
2. The user enters a guess in the input box and clicks the **Submit Guess** button.
3. The app checks the input and provides feedback:

   * Invalid input → Red warning
   * Too low/high → Orange hint
   * Correct → Green success message and number of attempts shown
4. The input is disabled after guessing correctly.
